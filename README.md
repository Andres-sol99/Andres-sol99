Andres Solis @Andres-sol99

My interest besides sitting in front of my computer all day are both watching/playing skateboarding, football (Go Rams), and golf.

BA in Political Science from Sacramento State University and recent Grad from Nucamp Full Stack program. Got tired of verbal debates with people and decided to have emotional battles with my laptop instead. 

Resident of our beatiful valley in central California.
